# leapfrog_scanner
This Repo allows users to scan their binary for leapfrog gadgets. To use, reference the poc folder. 

In the poc folder, you will see 3 bash scripts:

1. generate_gadget.sh
2. test_gadget.sh
3. kill_scanners.sh

# Building the pin tool

The pin tool is included in this repo. To build the *.so library files run the following:
```
cd pin-3.28/source/tools/ManualExamples
make
```

# Finding Potential Leapfrog Gadgets

First, you must run the generate_gadget.sh script. Inside the script there is a ```COMMAND``` variable. You can change that to whatever you want, by default it it set to the poc binary. 

```
make -C poc/poc_binary
chmod +x poc/generate_gadgets.sh
./poc/generate_gadgets.sh
```

This will generate 3 files: 

1. itrace.in (this contains a list of source -> jump addresses)
2. itrace.out (this contains the actual process trace)
3. return_addresses.txt (this contains all the PC addresses)

# Testing the Leapfrog Gadgets

Next, you can run the test_gadgets.sh script. This test all the source -> jump addresses in the itrace.in file. 

```
chmod +x ./poc/test_gadgets.sh
./poc/test_gadgets.sh
```

This will generate a few files, including:

1. pin.log
2. simulation_results.out
3. stdout_redirect.txt

Look at the stdout_redirect.txt file and do a search for the output you are looking for if the leapfrog gadet was successful.

Note that this script is hard to kill, so I included a kill_scanners.sh script that will kill all the scanners.
